Maybe what I mean to say is did they really have a chance. You can take two people, present them with the same fork in the road, and one is going to have an easier time than the other choosing the right path.</p><p>Is there such a thing as the right path? You could argue back and forth with God and Evolution and such topics. The side that you take in an arguement like that might lead you to think that you know the meaning to life. How can we really know though. At least up until now there isn’t and 100% proof to either side. If God was a gaurantee – why would he leave so many of us here to die, without the information or say it as proof that we individually would have needed to make that choice? If Evolution was a gaurantee – why would there be two thousand years of person to person proof that Jesus walked on Earth? We’ve already seen alot of weird things happen in our lifetime, and I think that we will see alot more. Our world is too much of an unstable place, and as time grows on we just grow out further. Every Civilization has fallen. How long do you think we have? Look at America. We’re built on a pretty rough foundation. Events like the Hurricanes, have humbled us, and showed us how vulnerable we are to things we can’t avoid. Our entire economy is built on Oil, and we are feeling the effects of the instability in the Oil world. Will the next war be over oil. Was the last one?</p><p>The Persian Gulf has over half of the word’s oil sitting underneath it, but they can’t seem to get their act together above the surface. The United States is the larget consumer of Oil, and they only have 3% of the world’s oil reserves. How long can they go on, being so dependent on Oil, and borrowing as much as they do. Well into the Trillions, the US is the world’s largest debtor. That makes me wonder where all that money is coming from. The 30’s showed us what happens when the markets collapse. Are we smart enough to keep our economy going in the 00’s? I don’t think so. Not when we have monkeys like Bush kicking about. Not to pick on him in particular but here are some funny links:</p><p>Have you ever had a problem with a burned light? Thanks to the effort of Thomas Edison we no longer need to invent a light bulb. We just go to the store or our cupboard and pull one out and screw it in. Voila! Light!</p><p>I am sure you realize that it took Thomas Edison many, many tries before he perfected the light bulb. Someone asked him one day if he grew discouraged by his failures. He answered, “I haven’t failed, I’ve discovered one more way how not to make a light bulb”.</p><p>You see, there is no such thing as failure, there are only results. Someone once said that the definition of Insanity is to do something over and over again and get the same results.</p><p>In order for our life to work properly we need to make some changes to the things we are doing.</p><p>Just like a light can burn out, so can we. Life can become dark and depressing and we feel there is no light, no hope in sight. It’s a fairly dismal picture for sure.</p><p>Let me shine some light on this situation (pun intended). When we are feeling so low and deep in the pits, this is when we need light to see our way through. Some of us are lucky enough to have some light on hand, others must go out and retrieve it.</p><p>Many people try and invent light for themselves by thinking positive thoughts but it only takes them so far. It only gives so much light. There is more light available but people are at a quandary as to how to obtain it.</p><p>We don’t have to be like Thomas Edison and keep looking at the problem and thinking of ways to solve them.</p><p>For every problem there is a Solution.</p><p>How do we find the solution? We can try, as we said, to try and figure it out by ourselves, or we can find someone who has already surpassed this obstacle and do what they did.</p><p>There are many books on the market today that can help us to understand how to overcome the obstacles in our lives. We need to read and learn from the failures of other people. They have been through it all before and can help to teach us how to go through it now. There have been great thinkers in our history and we are fortunate enough to have their trail to follow.</p><p>We all need more light in our life. Sometimes we can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel but there is always hope and help.</p><p>Learn how others have overcome their challenges and keep that education inside of you so that when you are feeling low and life looks dim, you can pull out those resources to help you light up your life again.</p><p>Don’t try to re-invent the light bulb, Learn how to carry the light within yourselves.</p></div></main><!-- End of Main--><!-- Footer--><a id="to-top" href="#top" class="scroll-top"><svg class="scroll-top__icon"><use xlink:href="images/icons.svg#arrow-up"></use></svg></a><footer><div class="container"><div class="ft__inner row"><section class="ft__links col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-lg-8"><div class="row"><div class="ft-menu col-xs-12 col-md-4"><h3 class="heading heading--footer">Services</h3><ul class="ft-menu__list"><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">How we help</a></li><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Representation</a></li><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Marketing & Brand Development</a></li><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Business & Profit Services</a></li></ul></div><div class="ft-menu col-xs-12 col-md-2"><h3 class="heading heading--footer">Clients</h3><ul class="ft-menu__list"><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Basketball</a></li><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Soccer</a></li><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Other</a></li></ul></div><div class="ft-menu col-xs-12 col-md-3"><h3 class="heading heading--footer">About Us</h3><ul class="ft-menu__list"><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Company</a></li><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Content Production</a></li><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Completed Projects</a></li><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Contact Us</a></li></ul></div><div class="ft-menu col-xs-12 col-md-3"><h3 class="heading heading--footer">Legal</h3><ul class="ft-menu__list"><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="" class="ft-menu__item">Terms & Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></section><section class="ft__subscription col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class="subscription"><form action="index.html" method="post" class="subscription__form"><input type="email" name="name" title="Enter your Email here" placeholder="Email" required="" class="subscription__input"><input type="submit" name="name" value="Subscribe" class="subscription__submit"></form></div><div class="social"><a href="#" class="social__link"><svg class="social__icon"><use xlink:href="images/icons.svg#soc-fb"></use></svg></a><a href="#" class="social__link"><svg class="social__icon"><use xlink:href="images/icons.svg#soc-tw"></use></svg></a><a href="#" class="social__link"><svg class="social__icon"><use xlink:href="images/icons.svg#soc-in"></use></svg></a><a href="#" class="social__link"><svg class="social__icon"><use xlink:href="images/icons.svg#soc-yt"></use></svg></a></div></section></div><hr class="hr--footer"><section class="ft__bottom"><div class="copyrights">Grandstand Sports & Entertainment Incorporated. 2016</div><svg class="ft__logo"><use xlink:href="images/icons.svg#logo"></use></svg></section></div></footer><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-gvQgAFzTH6trSrAWoH1iPo9Xc96QxSZ3feW6kem+O00=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-0mSbJDEHialfmuBBQP6A4Qrprq5OVfW37PRR3j5ELqxss1yVqOtnepnHVP9aJ7xS" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js"></script><script src="js/app.min.js"></script><!-- End of Footer--></body></html>
